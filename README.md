# MERN Bookmarks Application Tutorial

Welcome to the **Fullstack MERN Bookmarks Application** tutorial! ðŸŽ‰

In this lesson, you'll learn how to build a fullstack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional bookmarks application where you can add, delete, and manage your favorite bookmarks.

## Overview

### What You'll Learn

- **Frontend Development** with React: Create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend Development** with Node.js and Express: Build a robust API to handle bookmark data.
- **Database Management** with MongoDB: Store and retrieve bookmark information efficiently.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB

### Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Frontend**: The React application where users interact with the bookmarks.
2. **Backend**: The Node.js and Express server that handles API requests and connects to MongoDB.
